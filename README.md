python socket practices  

before running the file, make sure you have got the following modules:

client.py: socket, threading, tkinter, os  
server.py: socket, threading, time, re, os

now we have name changing func! use /setname \[new name] to set your shown name to \[new name]

now we have private chats! use /tell \[name] \[message] to send \[message] to \[name]

now we have checkup func! use /member to checkup who's in the room

now we have file messages!
